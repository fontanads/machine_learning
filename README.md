# Machine Learning Labs

Public labs on Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

I will post some codes here while I study and evolve in the use of Python for ML.

Feel free to concact me if you have any questions or if you wish to colaborate on something.

## [Competitions]()

### Primeira Imersão de Ciência de Dados da Alura Cursos Online

Local competition promoted by [Alura Cursos Online](https://www.alura.com.br/). The challenge was to predict the score of Portuguese Language tests based on the score on other subjects of the National Exam of High School students. I have used PyTorch to create a simple neuralnetwork (only dense hidden layers and ReLU activation functions) to estimte regression value for the score. It did not win the competition, but it was a nice study case.
